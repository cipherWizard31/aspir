## 📖 About The Project

Most apps make you choose between tracking life goals and tracking things you want to buy. **Aspir** bridges that gap. Whether you're planning a trip to Japan or saving for a new camera, keep all your aspirations organized, prioritized, and actionable in a single dashboard.

### ✨ Key Features
- **🪣 Bucket List Mode:** Track experiences, trips, and life goals with progress bars and completion dates.
- **🎁 Wish List Mode:** Save items, add price tags, track links, and mark as "purchased".
- **📊 Progress Dashboard:** Visualize how many dreams you've fulfilled vs. what's pending.
- **🔒 Private by Default:** Your dreams are personal. Data is encrypted and user-specific.
